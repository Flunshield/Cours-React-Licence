## Introduction:
This project summarizes all the points covered during the week of classes in REACT . I used for this project REACT with TypeScript.

## Installation
For the installation of the project, you will have to install two projects and a database:
->  [Le BACK](https://github.com/JulienBertrand-ISITECH/CSharp/tree/main/APIWeb)
-> [Le FRONT](https://github.com/JulienBertrand-ISITECH/React/tree/main/project-react)
-> Wamp

For the database, launch Wamp and create a database named "apiweb".

As soon as the projects have been downloaded, launch the **BACK** (nb. the BACK was done in C#) with the following command:
```dotnet
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

Don't forget to run the migrations after initializing your database!

For the **FRONT**, use the following command:
```npm
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
```
